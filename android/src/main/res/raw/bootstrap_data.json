Now with Android Wear, Android has extended to a new environment which is much adoptable than Glass. However, Wear comes with a price, with wear once again we have new UI, UX and set of APIs.This talk intends to give a deep dive into whole new UI, UX and development tools introduced by Android L, Android Wear and the Google Glass showing ways to integrate each and offer a smooth flow between all android platforms.",

Different approaches of handling this issue.- Do's and dont's of Guava for Android.And more!",

And many conferences have around 8-10% women visibility at most. Some researches also show while conferences with the soft subject matter such as user experience, web design has more women speakers and attendees, hight tech conferences have low woman proportions. The focus of this speech is on attempts to give more visibility to women at high-tech conferences. The experiences and challenges of a member of a community that organises conferences with the around 50% of women inclusion and solutions will be presented.",

Some day I decided to embed some kind of brain into my construction. I used Lego EV3 intellectual brick. I found that my microscope become more and more interesting. I decided to send my idea to Google Science Fair. One day I received fantastic news. I was selected to 90 regional finalists. I added more efforts. Finally my robo-microscope had 3 optical systems and 4 servo motors. It has option of remote control and integration with Google Hangouts.
