Most libs now rely on annotation processing during build to pre-compute a lot of stuff that will boost them at runtime. Let’s think about Dagger, ButerKnife, Hugo, RoboGuice, BoundBox, Memento, IcePick etc.

Nevertheless, writing an annotation processor is far from obvious as it offers an API that is very difficult to understand. The main idea of this session is to suggest an alternative technology (or a complement in some cases): post-compilation processing and byte code manipulation.

This session is an in-depth review of byte code manipulation in Java and its limitations on Android. Stéphane will also explore a few techniques and librairies that make it simple to write a post compiler byte code processor, with gradle and maven examples. He will be presenting two librairies during his session: AfterBurner and Mimic.

See how to eliminate all boiler plate from your favorite librairies and boost your applications.",

With its unique features, like closures, builders, code transformations, traits, static compilation and many others, Groovy has become a very competitive language on the JVM platform. Compared to other alternative JVM languages, Groovy has the advantage of offering the best interoperability story with Java, while still keeping a concise syntax familiar to Java developers.
What about the mobile story? In particular, with Android, developers basically only hava Java as sole choice.
Couldn’t they too benefit from advantages provided by Groovy?
Can’t we make Android developers life less painful too?
In this session, Guillaume will show how you can use Groovy to develop Android applications, bringing all the productivity and modernity Groovy provides on the Android platform.
He will also explain the potential issues you might be encountering, but if you are jealous of your iOS friends with Swift, get your smile back, Groovy is there for you!",

In short, do we have the right to launch the application ?

This is for this reason and their wish to tackle this painful issue that thet have worked on automatical functional tests for mobile applications and the tool Calaba.sh in particular. Why and how can we write high level automatical tests? What executive strategy can we opt for?

In this talk, Cédric and Jean-Loup will be answering these questions. They will give feedback on their experience and will show you how they integrated this tool to their development cycle.",

Even if there’s only scarce documentation for it, the Canvas API is at the heart of everything that shows a UI on Android. You’ll need to tame this powerful and mysterious creature if you want to create great custom views and brilliant, lightweight UIs for your apps.

What is a Canvas? How do you Paint? Can you draw Paths? What is Skia, and who invited it anyway? What actually happens during a drawing pass? What are Shaders? What are Filters? Is it true that text is basically impossible to measure correctly? What shape does a Shape have if noone’s painting it? These are some of the questions which will be answered during the session.

Connect the dots in the spotty documentation the Android team has assembled, and become a true pixel pusher!",
