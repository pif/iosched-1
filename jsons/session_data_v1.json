Now with Android Wear, Android has extended to a new environment which is much adoptable than Glass. However, Wear comes with a price, with wear once again we have new UI, UX and set of APIs.This talk intends to give a deep dive into whole new UI, UX and development tools introduced by Android L, Android Wear and the Google Glass showing ways to integrate each and offer a smooth flow between all android platforms.",

And it's applicable also for Android. However, many developers limit its usage to simple Collections' transformations and filters, not revealing many advantages coming with the whole lib.During my presentation I'll also cover some android-specific topics like:- Guava your ContentResolverish boilerplate- 65K method limit hurts your app and Guava uses too many?
